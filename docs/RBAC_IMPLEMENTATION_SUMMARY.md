# RBAC Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for AdminUsers as per the PRD requirements. This system enables company admins to create team members with specific permissions for managing jobs and company posts.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **AdminUser Model**: Added RBAC fields (`broker_id`, `role_group_id`, `type`)
- **CompanyPost Model**: Added `adminUserId` field to track creator
- **New Models**: `RoleGroup` with permissions array
- **New Enums**: `AdminUserType` (ADMIN/MEMBER), `Permission` (8 permissions)
- **Relations**: One-to-one relationships between AdminUser-Broker, AdminUser-RoleGroup

### 2. Permission System
- **Job Permissions**: CREATE_JOB, EDIT_JOB, DELETE_JOB, VIEW_JOB
- **Company Post Permissions**: CREATE_COMPANY_POST, EDIT_COMPANY_POST, DELETE_COMPANY_POST, VIEW_COMPANY_POST
- **Individual-level Access**: Users can only edit/delete their own content
- **Admin Override**: Admin users have full access to all company resources

### 3. Core Utilities
- **PermissionChecker Class** (`src/utils/permissions.ts`):
  - `hasPermission()` - Check specific permission
  - `canAccessResource()` - Resource-level access validation
  - `isResourceOwner()` - Ownership verification
  - `getUserPermissions()` - Get all user permissions
  - `getAccessibleJobs()` - RBAC-filtered job queries
  - `getAccessibleCompanyPosts()` - RBAC-filtered post queries

### 4. RBAC Middleware
- **requirePermission()** - Validates specific permissions
- **requireResourceAccess()** - Validates resource-level access
- **requireAdminAccess()** - Admin-only operations
- **requireTeamManagementAccess()** - Team management operations

### 5. Service Layer
#### Team Member Management (`src/services/team-member.service.ts`):
- Create team members linked to company brokers
- Update team member roles
- Delete team members with proper cleanup
- Get available brokers for assignment

#### Role Group Management (`src/services/role-group.service.ts`):
- CRUD operations for role groups
- Permission assignment and validation
- Usage tracking (prevent deletion of used roles)

#### Updated Admin Services:
- RBAC-aware job and post retrieval
- Individual-level access validation
- Admin vs member filtering logic

### 6. API Endpoints
All endpoints implemented in `src/routes/admin-user.routes.ts`:

#### Team Member Management:
- `POST /api/admin-user/team-members` - Create team member
- `GET /api/admin-user/team-members` - List team members
- `PUT /api/admin-user/team-members/:id/role` - Update member role
- `DELETE /api/admin-user/team-members/:id` - Delete member
- `GET /api/admin-user/available-brokers` - Available brokers

#### Role Group Management:
- `POST /api/admin-user/role-groups` - Create role group
- `GET /api/admin-user/role-groups` - List role groups
- `GET /api/admin-user/role-groups/:id` - Get role group
- `PUT /api/admin-user/role-groups/:id` - Update role group
- `DELETE /api/admin-user/role-groups/:id` - Delete role group

#### Utility:
- `GET /api/admin-user/permissions` - Available permissions

### 7. Updated Existing Endpoints
Protected with RBAC middleware:
- Job creation: Requires `CREATE_JOB` permission
- Job deletion: Requires `DELETE_JOB` + ownership
- Company post creation: Requires `CREATE_COMPANY_POST`
- Company post editing: Requires `EDIT_COMPANY_POST` + ownership
- All GET endpoints: RBAC-filtered results

### 8. Database Migration
- Successfully migrated existing data
- Preserved existing admin users as type "ADMIN"
- Added unique constraints for broker-admin relationships

### 9. Demo Data & Testing
- **Demo Script**: `src/scripts/rbac-demo-seed.ts`
- **Sample Role Groups**: Job Manager, Post Manager, Full Access, Read Only
- **Test Users**: Different permission levels for testing
- **Test Credentials**: demo123 password for all test users

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Business Rules Implemented

### Access Control Rules:
1. **Admin Users (Type: ADMIN)**:
   - Can create, edit, delete team members
   - Can manage role groups and permissions
   - Can view ALL jobs and company posts in their company
   - Have full access to company resources

2. **Team Members (Type: MEMBER)**:
   - Can only perform actions they have explicit permissions for
   - Can only view/edit/delete their own created content (individual-level)
   - Cannot create other team members
   - Must be linked to a broker within the company

3. **Data Isolation**:
   - All operations are company-scoped
   - No cross-company data access
   - Permission checks at both API and service levels

4. **Broker Assignment**:
   - Each team member must be linked to a company broker
   - One-to-one relationship between AdminUser and Broker
   - Only unlinked brokers can be assigned

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Security Features:
- **Multi-layer Validation**: API â†’ Middleware â†’ Service â†’ Database
- **Company Isolation**: All queries filter by company_id
- **Ownership Verification**: Individual-level permissions check creator
- **Admin Bypass**: Admin users have full company access

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Permission Caching**: Efficient permission lookups
- **Filtered Queries**: RBAC filtering at database level
- **Minimal Database Calls**: Optimized permission checking

### Error Handling:
- **Graceful Failures**: Proper error messages for access denied
- **Validation**: Input validation at all levels
- **Logging**: Audit trail for permission checks

## ðŸ§ª Testing Guide

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Admin Operations**:
   - Create team members with different roles
   - Assign brokers to team members
   - View all company jobs and posts

2. **Permission Testing**:
   - Login as job-manager@demo.com â†’ Should only manage jobs
   - Login as post-manager@demo.com â†’ Should only manage posts
   - Login as readonly@demo.com â†’ Should only view content

3. **Access Restrictions**:
   - Try accessing other team members' content
   - Attempt unauthorized operations
   - Cross-company access attempts

### Demo Credentials:
- **Job Manager**: job-manager@demo.com / demo123
- **Post Manager**: post-manager@demo.com / demo123
- **Read Only**: readonly@demo.com / demo123

## ðŸ“‹ API Usage Examples

### Create Team Member:
```bash
POST /api/admin-user/team-members
{
  "brokerId": "broker-uuid",
  "email": "teammember@company.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "roleGroupId": "role-group-uuid"
}
```

### Create Role Group:
```bash
POST /api/admin-user/role-groups
{
  "name": "Content Manager",
  "description": "Can manage both jobs and posts",
  "permissions": ["CREATE_JOB", "EDIT_JOB", "CREATE_COMPANY_POST"]
}
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Phase 2 Enhancements:
1. **Listing Permissions**: Extend RBAC to listing management
2. **Analytics Access**: Permission-based analytics viewing
3. **Custom Permissions**: Dynamic permission creation
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all permission-based actions
5. **Role Templates**: Pre-defined role templates for common use cases

### Monitoring & Maintenance:
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track permission check performance
2. **Usage Analytics**: Monitor role group usage patterns
3. **Security Audits**: Regular permission system reviews
