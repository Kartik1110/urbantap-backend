Step 1: Define the Credit System

Credit Pack | AED Price | Credits Included | Effective Rate per Credit

Basic Pack — AED 500 → 500 credits (AED 1.00)

Value Pack — AED 2,000 → 2,200 credits (AED 0.91)

Pro Pack — AED 5,000 → 6,000 credits (AED 0.83)

Enterprise Pack — AED 10,000 → 12,500 credits (AED 0.80)

Ad Types & Credit Costs

Ad Product | Placement Area | Credit Cost | Visibility Duration

Homepage Banner — Homepage (Top carousel or AI slot) → 1,500 credits → 3 days

Featured Listing — Top of search & "Trending" feed → 300 credits → 7 days

Featured Job — Broker job board + email push → 250 credits → 7 days

Example Journey – Developer Campaign

Let’s say “Emaar Properties”, a developer, buys the AED 5,000 Pro Pack → gets 6,000 credits.

Month 1 Ad Plan:

Product | Quantity | Cost/Unit (credits) | Total Credits

Homepage Banner — 2 × 1,500 = 3,000

Featured Listings — 5 × 300 = 1,500

Featured Jobs — 2 × 250 = 500
Total = 5,000

They still have 1,000 credits left, which they can use to:
